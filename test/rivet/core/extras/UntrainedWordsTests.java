Finnis\n\nDepartment of Semiotics, University of California\n\n1. Pynchon and dialectic theory\n\n“Sexual identity is intrinsically elitist,” says Baudrillard; however,\naccording to Cameron[1] , it is not so much sexual identity\nthat is intrinsically elitist, but rather the meaninglessness, and subsequent\nfailure, of sexual identity. In a sense, the subject is interpolated into a\nrealism that includes reality as a paradox. Sartre’s essay on the neotextual\nparadigm of context implies that society has significance.\n\nThe primary theme of Humphrey’s[2] model of dialectic\npostdeconstructivist theory is the role of the participant as artist. But the\nmain theme of the works of Pynchon is a cultural whole. The example of\nsubconceptualist libertarianism which is a central theme of Pynchon’s Mason\n& Dixon emerges again in Vineland, although in a more\nself-sufficient sense.\n\nHowever, a number of constructions concerning the paradigm, and eventually\nthe meaninglessness, of capitalist sexual identity may be discovered. The\npremise of the neotextual paradigm of context suggests that narrativity serves\nto entrench sexism.\n\nThus, Tilton[3] holds that the works of Pynchon are\nempowering. The characteristic theme of Humphrey’s[4] essay\non Foucaultist power relations is not theory, as Bataille would have it, but\nneotheory.\n\nIn a sense, the neotextual paradigm of context implies that culture is part\nof the genre of truth. The main theme of the works of Pynchon is the common\nground between class and sexual identity.\n2. Textual discourse and Foucaultist power relations\n\n“Society is dead,” says Lacan. It could be said that the premise of the\nneotextual paradigm of context states that reality, perhaps ironically, has\nobjective value, given that art is distinct from truth. Several\ndeappropriations concerning Foucaultist power relations exist.\n\nIf one examines realism, one is faced with a choice: either accept\nFoucaultist power relations or conclude that government is capable of truth.\nTherefore, the primary theme of Prinn’s[5] critique of the\nneotextual paradigm of context is not construction, but neoconstruction. If\nrealism holds, we have to choose between Foucaultist power relations and\ncapitalist objectivism.\n\nThus, the subject is contextualised into a pretextual cultural theory that\nincludes narrativity as a reality. The characteristic theme of the works of\nPynchon is a subdialectic totality.\n\nBut the ground/figure distinction prevalent in Pynchon’s Gravity’s\nRainbow is also evident in Mason & Dixon. Many dematerialisms\nconcerning not discourse as such, but postdiscourse may be revealed.\n\nThus, realism suggests that consciousness is used to disempower the\nproletariat. La Tournier[6] implies that the works of\nPynchon are postmodern.\n\nHowever, if predialectic constructive theory holds, we have to choose\nbetween Foucaultist power relations and subdialectic libertarianism. The\nprimary theme of Hanfkopf’s[7] essay on the neotextual\nparadigm of context is the difference between culture and class.\n3. Pynchon and realism\n\nThe main theme of the works of Pynchon is a mythopoetical paradox.\nTherefore, Sontag suggests the use of Foucaultist power relations to read\nsexual identity. The premise of realism holds that reality is a product of the\nmasses.\n\n“Class is fundamentally used in the service of the status quo,” says\nLyotard. But several appropriations concerning the neotextual paradigm of\ncontext exist. Sontag’s analysis of neocapitalist capitalism states that\nsociety has intrinsic meaning, given that the neotextual paradigm of context is\ninvalid.\n\nIn the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the distinction between\nfeminine and masculine. In a sense, Tilton[8] holds that we\nhave to choose between cultural discourse and Foucaultist power relations. The\nsubject is interpolated into a realism that includes reality as a whole.\n\nThe characteristic theme of Porter’s[9] critique of the\nneotextual paradigm of context is the fatal flaw, and therefore the rubicon, of\nsubmaterial class. It could be said that the premise of realism suggests that\nthe purpose of the reader is social comment. Derrida promotes the use of\ntextual desituationism to challenge hierarchy.\n\nTherefore, the main theme of the works of Gibson is the bridge between\nsexual identity and consciousness. Sartre’s essay on Foucaultist power\nrelations states that sexual identity, somewhat paradoxically, has\nsignificance.\n\nHowever, Baudrillard suggests the use of the neotextual paradigm of context\nto analyse and read society. The subject is contextualised into a precultural\ndialectic theory that includes culture as a reality.\n\nIn a sense, realism holds that sexuality serves to reinforce class\ndivisions. The subject is interpolated into a Foucaultist power relations that\nincludes art as a totality.\n\nIt could be said that Sartre’s analysis of the neotextual paradigm of\ncontext states that the significance of the observer is significant form, given\nthat reality is equal to truth. If Foucaultist power relations holds, we have\nto choose between neocapitalist narrative and semioticist rationalism.\n\nHowever, the primary theme of Bailey’s[10] model of the\nneotextual paradigm of context is the role of the artist as reader. Lyotard\nuses the term ‘realism’ to denote the difference between narrativity and\nsociety.\n\nIn a sense, the subject is contextualised into a Foucaultist power relations\nthat includes truth as a whole. A number of dematerialisms concerning not, in\nfact, discourse, but postdiscourse may be found.";
        test_text_b = "The Reality of Absurdity: Sartreist absurdity and conceptualist\ndiscourse\nStefan M. K. Sargeant\n\nDepartment of Future Studies, University of Illinois\n\n1. Capitalist narrative and the postcultural paradigm of reality\n\nThe primary theme of Porter’s[1] critique of\nconceptualist discourse is not discourse, as the postcultural paradigm of\nreality suggests, but prediscourse. But conceptualist discourse implies that\nconsensus is created by communication, given that art is distinct from reality.\nFoucault uses the term ‘conceptual semanticism’ to denote a mythopoetical\ntotality.\n\n“Society is part of the rubicon of sexuality,” says Baudrillard; however,\naccording to Parry[2] , it is not so much society that is\npart of the rubicon of sexuality, but rather the rubicon, and subsequent\nstasis, of society. In a sense, several discourses concerning Sartreist\nabsurdity may be found. Lyotard promotes the use of conceptualist discourse to\nchallenge sexism.\n\nBut if Sartreist absurdity holds, we have to choose between subdialectic\ntextual theory and postcapitalist rationalism. Many deconstructions concerning\nthe role of the artist as observer exist.\n\nIn a sense, Wilson[3] states that the works of Rushdie\nare an example of self-supporting capitalism. Debord uses the term ‘Sartreist\nabsurdity’ to denote the collapse of dialectic art.\n\nTherefore, Derrida suggests the use of conceptualist discourse to attack and\nread society. The main theme of the works of Stone is not discourse, but\nneodiscourse.\n\nThus, Sartre promotes the use of the postcultural paradigm of reality to\nchallenge capitalism. Baudrillard uses the term ‘conceptualist discourse’ to\ndenote the dialectic, and subsequent paradigm, of posttextual narrativity.\n2. Narratives of futility\n\nThe primary theme of Dahmus’s[4] model of the\npostcultural paradigm of reality is a mythopoetical whole. It could be said\nthat if capitalist situationism holds, we have to choose between Sartreist\nabsurdity and subcultural socialism. Marx suggests the use of conceptualist\ndiscourse to deconstruct class.\n\nHowever, Finnis[5] implies that we have to choose between\nthe postcultural paradigm of reality and constructive discourse. Bataille’s\nessay on Sartreist absurdity holds that sexual identity has objective value.\n\nBut Baudrillard promotes the use of conceptualist discourse to challenge\nsexism. The subject is contextualised into a postcultural paradigm of reality\nthat includes culture as a paradox.\n3. Conceptualist discourse and subcapitalist dialectic theory\n\n“Class is fundamentally unattainable,” says Sontag. However, if\nsubcapitalist dialectic theory holds, we have to choose between Sartreist\nabsurdity and the premodern paradigm of context. Subcapitalist dialectic theory\nstates that narrativity is impossible, but only if the premise of cultural\ntheory is invalid; otherwise, Lyotard’s model of subcapitalist dialectic theory\nis one of “posttextual nationalism”, and therefore intrinsically meaningless.\n\nIf one examines conceptualist discourse, one is faced with a choice: either\nreject dialectic discourse or conclude that the State is capable of significant\nform. But any number of narratives concerning subcapitalist dialectic theory\nmay be discovered. In Heaven and Earth, Stone denies Sartreist\nabsurdity; in JFK, however, he reiterates subdeconstructivist nihilism.\n\nIt could be said that the subject is interpolated into a subcapitalist\ndialectic theory that includes art as a totality. Marx uses the term ‘dialectic\ndiscourse’ to denote not theory per se, but neotheory.\n\nIn a sense, the subject is contextualised into a conceptualist discourse\nthat includes culture as a paradox. Dahmus[6] holds that we\nhave to choose between subcapitalist dialectic theory and the prestructural\nparadigm of consensus.\n\nThus, Lacan uses the term ‘cultural rationalism’ to denote the common ground\nbetween society and truth. If subcapitalist dialectic theory holds, we have to\nchoose between conceptualist discourse and the neoconstructive paradigm of\nreality.";
