Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT UK Submission Positions .
Need your help following : Each day we delayed finalising var , p L positions because UK must wait a USD interest rate curves before submitting data Houston .
I am also told really not necessary wait curve data could submitted close business London .
Even some minor inaccuracy from method would better than what we have now .
This would greatly improve efficiency hours reporting senior management .
Can you guys initiate change get me right person .
Thanks , Rick .
