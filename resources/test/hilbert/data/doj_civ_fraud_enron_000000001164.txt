The above transaction presented Board -29 -201 .
There considerable discussion which I have summarized below .
Returns : were returns sufficient syndicate risk .
I answered positively , which what capital price addresses .
The dash return a blended debt equity return .
Was million excess proceeds enough allow company operate .
I answered yes since reserves producing little capital needed develop pdnp pud reserves .
Is management capable operating chapter again soon .
I answered bankruptcy a result overpaying Wyoming deal low commodity prices last two years which resulted a bb decrease below outstanding .
We have watch issue carefully .
Are banks reluctant support KCS could cause a liquidity problem ?
