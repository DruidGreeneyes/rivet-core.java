London PRC .
Spoke John Sherriff am re prc London RAC people .
John said included our people cross calibration purposes we could rank our people where we saw fit .
So I do n't think any issue here .
The Houston PRC rankings should stand unless new information brought light you Steve calls question a person 's ranking .
Sheila please double check London HR people straightened out .
Thanks , Rick .
