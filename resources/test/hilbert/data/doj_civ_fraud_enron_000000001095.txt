DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT AKA ELECTROBOLT ) .
fyi , please respond , tx rick .
Larry L Izzo@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT / 19/200 :04 AM DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT AKA ELECTROBOLT ) .
Rick , I provided a copy DASH :30 PM last evening asked sign off soonest .
My comments follow : Cost : DASH incorrect .
EECC has provided both a cost plus price a guaranteed price .
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price 215MM .
EECC has indicated 's estimate actual costs most likely 205MM .
We indicated cost estimate somewhat conservative .
Since last week , cost estimate has been further revised 202MM .
It unlikely actual costs project significantly less than 202MM .
202MM represents a cost estimate Owners maintaining risk overruns schedule .
This would require Owner maintain a contingency his proforma above most likely expected cost 202MM .
After providing above information Developer , Developer going take a look carrying cost turbines which were inside estimate ; I have update whether turbine price changed from numbers I saw last week .
Schedule : Neither my team nor I had seen provisions termination Petrobras , stated DASH , prior last evening .
The ability Petrobras terminate April project not completed due circumstances within Enron 's controls , unlikely risk , not totally impossible .
Further , project subject a June , termination Petrobras project not completed due force majeure .
This considered more onerous risk .
It 's not clear me whether requirement complete pipeline bring gas project would considered under Enron 's control , considering Enron a partial Owner CEG , gas distribution pipeline company .
On other hand , we have indicated October start-up , reasonable , based a full NTP January site access February If schedule constrained RAC recommendation limit expenses 15MM , October start-up could risk .
Performance : The stated agreement Petrobras megawatts site condition average net degraded heat rate btu/kWH , appears correct , LHV .
O&M Guarantee : The DASH not clear what O&M availability guarantee Enron prepared sign Petrobras .
I would suggest OEC insure agrees any availability guarantees prior Enron signing Petrobras agreement .
Rick , sorry late feedback , our system coordination RAC needs improvement .
In days when I worked EI , EECC would provide EI a written due diligence report direct , after checking proforma against PPA .
This Enron lesson-learned after years experience .
The recent reorganizations have diluted procedure .
I suggest I discuss you how improve our due diligence process .
